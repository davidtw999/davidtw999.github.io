			<pre class="text-content">I finished the bachelor Computer Science and Mechatronics engineering double degrees at The University of Melbourne in 2009. 
Previously, the work experience that I had is to maintain the supply chain system on the backend in the Australian logistics industry 
for four years, and also developed Blockchain Technology on cryptocurrency in China for two years. Currently, I am taking on the 
research minor thesis unit for the master of Data Science at Monash University for the last year.</pre>

				<a><span>Skills<span></a>
			</div>
			<pre class="text-content">The key three skills that I have learned from these years are programming development, data visualisation, and communication. 
The programming languages involve the backend and frontend languages. The backend programming languages mainly used in 
programming development which involve C, SQL, Shell script, Python and Haskell. The frontend programming languages mainly 
used in data visualisation which involve Javascript, D3.js, R, Matlab, HTML. Documenting, story-telling and reporting mainly used 
for industrial communication.</pre>

				<a><span>Interests<span></a>
			</div>
			<pre class="text-content">Nowadays, advanced technology emerges differing from the traditional method of dealing with data, such as Machine Learning and 
Artificial Intelligence. These technologies are used in Data Science for improving the industry application performance in the Big 
Data era. It is a new way to explore the correlation from the data to improve the outcomes for many applications. 

Therefore, the research area that I am willing to focus on how Data Science applied in industrial applications. Specifically, 
the interaction between human knowledge and computer data is a relevant topic that I would like to raise in my 
research. These are related to Data Science area as well.
